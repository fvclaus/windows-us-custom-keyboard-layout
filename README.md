# US International Custom Keyboard Layout

## Motivation
I wanted to use the same keyboard shortcuts from Linux in Windows. For example Alt+Gr+u for usages in my IDE.

## Solution
This keyboard layout is identical to US_INTL except for the Alt+Gr keys. I have kept only the ones I use so that the other combinations can be used as keyboard shortcuts in applications.
